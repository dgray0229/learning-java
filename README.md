#Introduction to Java
This is material based on the Learning Java course on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Java-tutorials/Learning-Java-2018/669544-2.html). This course covers the fundamentals of Java from how to compile your first Java file to common programming paradigms including object-oriented and functional programming.

 I took this course to expand my knowledge of backend programming languages, and learn more about strongly-typed languages. I learned more about defining types and interfaces, which helps me understand TypeScript that much better, importing classes, public and private methods, and lambdas. 
 
 A lot of my code and notes are commented out but you can uncomment different sections of the __Main.java__ file and run them, testing out different aspects of Java programming.
